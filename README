# Jishnu's Personal Chatbot

A personal AI assistant that can answer questions about Jishnu Vivaswanth Raviprolu using his resume data stored in MongoDB.

## What it can tell you about:
- Education & Academic Background
- Professional Work Experience  
- Technical Projects
- Teaching & Research Experience
- Volunteer Work

## How to use:

### Prerequisites:
- Docker installed and running
- Google Cloud CLI configured
- Python environment with required packages

### Quick Start:
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
!!!!!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT:  If the .env file is not present in the \chatbot directory, create one and ask the owner for the APIs. !!!!!!!!!!!!

2. Navigate to MYBOT(root) directory and start with the startup script:
   ```bash
   python start_agent.py
   ```

3. The startup script will automatically:
   - Check if MongoDB MCP container is running
   - Create/start the container if needed
   - Launch the ADK web interface

4. Open `http://localhost:8000` and start with "Hello"

5. Don't forget to stop the containers once finished.
```bash
docker rm -f mongodb-mcp-persistent
```

6. Once you run the start_agent.py, you don't need to rerun it if it closes. Just run -  
```bash
adk web
```

### Alternative (manual):
If you prefer to manage the container separately:
```bash
cd MYBOT
adk web  # Make sure MongoDB container is running first
```

## Technical Details:
- Uses Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)
- MongoDB Atlas database via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Docker container for MCP server management
- Gemini 2.0 Flash model

## Notes:
- First run may take a moment to pull Docker image
- Container is automatically managed by the startup script
- All data queries go through MongoDB (no built-in knowledge used)
